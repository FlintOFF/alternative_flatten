# alternative_flatten
Alternative to method flatten in Ruby

This is the answer to the test task.
The assignment was
```
Write some code, that will flatten an array of arbitrarily nested arrays of integers into a flat array of integers. e.g. [[1,2,[3]],4] -> [1,2,3,4].
Try to avoid using language defined methods like Ruby's Array#flatten.
```
I did even more, my method can work with strings.
